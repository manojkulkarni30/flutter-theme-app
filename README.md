# flutter_theme_app

A simple Flutter example showing how to implement light and dark themes using:

- the system-based approach (follow system appearance), and
- a manual in-app toggle (switch theme from inside the app).

## Features

- Automatic system theme detection (light/dark).
- Manual toggle to override system theme.
- Material 3 compatible theming with ColorScheme usage.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Run the app on a device or emulator: `flutter run`.
